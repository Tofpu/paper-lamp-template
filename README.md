# paper-lamp-template

A template for my typical day-to-day workflow, which consists of the following:
- [Lamp](https://github.com/Revxrsal/Lamp) - my personal favoriate command framework.
- [Run task](https://github.com/jpenilla/run-task) - a gradle plugin which facilitates server launch within the IDE.
- [Shadow](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow) - a gradle plugin for creating uber/fat jars, relocating dependencies, and so on.  


## Todo:  
- [ ] Dependency Injection
  - Dagger2
